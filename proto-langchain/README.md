# proto-langchain

## explore 
A few notebooks to explore the basics of langchain.

## doc-talk-v1
A chatbot that talks to a user conditioned on one PDF document.

## doc-talk-v2
`NOTE`: Just a stub in the README for now.    
A chatbot that talks to a user conditioned on **multiple** PDF documents.    
**Why?** Overcomes OpenAI token limitations by relying on open-source alternatives.

## lit-bot
`NOTE`: Just a stub in the README for now.    
Scrape ArXiV daily. Compute text embeddings for PDF. Send 5 recommended readings to user inbox every day.    
**Why?** Build something useful someone other than me would use.    
(This is a non-trivial project. See [lit-bot](https://github.com/ishann/lit-bot).)
