## 5.1.1 Vectors

[2] Outer Product
(ii) Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML.

[4] Given two sets of vectors $$A=a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$ and $$B=b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$$, how do you check that they share the same basis?

[5] Given $$n$$ vectors, each of $$d$$ dimensions, what is the dimension of their span?

[6] Norms and metrics
(ii) How do a norm and a metric differ? Given a norm, make a metric. Given a metric, can we make a norm?

## 5.1.2 Matrices
[5] A $$4\times4$$  matrix has four eigenvalues $$3,3,2,âˆ’1$$. What can we say about the trace and the determinant of this matrix?
