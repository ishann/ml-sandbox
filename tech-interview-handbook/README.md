Practice DSA problems in the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org).
Also, implement problems following common [Coding Patterns](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview).

Each file contains self-sufficient code to run the solution on test-cases.

This may not be a good idea. The overhead in maintaining runnable code for non-trivial data-structures is too high.
